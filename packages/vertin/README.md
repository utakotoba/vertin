### Vertin

Vertin is a universal command-line application scaffolding tool designed to help you build CLI applications with ease. It is fully typed and follows a functional programming style as its foundation. Vertin enforces a consistent command-line application structure, including built-in features such as a help command. It also offers useful utilities for building robust CLIs, such as a centralized logging system, colorized output helpers, and more.

> This project is in an early stage of development, and it will take some time to complete the major features.
